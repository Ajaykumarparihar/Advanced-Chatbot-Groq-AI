Groq Chat Streamlit App
This Streamlit app integrates with the Groq API to provide a chat interface where users can interact with advanced language models. It allows users to choose between two models for generating responses, enhancing the flexibility and user experience of the chat application.

Features
Model Selection: Users can select between mixtral-8x7b-32768, llama2-70b-4096, Gemma-7b-it, llama2-70b-4096, llama3-70b-8192, and lama3-8b-8192 models to tailor the conversation according to each model's capabilities.
Chat History: The app maintains a session-based chat history, allowing for a continuous conversation flow during the app session.
Dynamic Response Generation: Utilizes a generator function to stream responses from the Groq API, providing a seamless chat experience.
Error Handling: Implements try-except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully during API calls.
Setup and Installation
Install Dependencies:
pip install streamlit groq
Set Up Groq API Key: Ensure you have an API key from Groq. This key should be stored securely using Streamlit's secrets management. Create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file in your project directory and add your Groq API key:
# .streamlit/secrets.toml
GROQ_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
Run the App: Navigate to the app's directory and run:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Usage
Upon launching the app, you are greeted with a title and a model selection dropdown. After choosing a preferred model, you can interact with the chat interface by entering prompts. The app displays the user's questions and the AI's responses, facilitating a back-and-forth conversation.

Customization
The app can be easily customized to include additional language models (as Groq adds more), alter the user interface, or extend the functionality to incorporate other interactions with the Groq API.
